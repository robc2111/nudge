// goalGeneration.js
module.exports = (goal) => `
You are a senior productivity coach and information architect.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no prose, no code fences), matching EXACTLY this structure:
{
  "goal": "string",
  "subgoals": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "title": "string",
          "microtasks": ["string", "string", "..."]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Hard rules:
- Output must be valid JSON and match the structure above EXACTLY (no extra fields).
- "goal" should be a concise rewrite of the user's goal (≤120 chars), preserving intent.
- 3–5 subgoals total; each subgoal should be completable in 3–7 days.
- 2–5 tasks per subgoal; each task should be completable in < 1 day (≤6 hrs focused work).
- 3–5 microtasks per task; each microtask must be atomic (≤25 minutes), start with an action verb, and be self-contained.
- Avoid duplicates and vague items like "research" or "plan" without a concrete outcome.
- If suggesting resources, bake them into microtasks (e.g., "Skim MDN guide on Fetch API and note 3 gotchas") since no resource field exists.
- Use clear, friendly phrasing, but DO NOT include commentary outside the JSON.
- Language: English.

Quality criteria:
- Specific outcomes (what gets produced/decided).
- Logical ordering (dependencies appear earlier).
- Consistent level of granularity across tasks.
- Scope fits a realistic 2–4 week delivery for the whole plan.
