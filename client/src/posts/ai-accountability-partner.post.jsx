      <h2>Big goals are scary</h2>
      <p>
        Big goals can be overwhelming. We may have a compelling vision of what
        we want to achieve, but where do we start? What’s the first step?
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a clear direction—and when the task before us seems
        monumental—we’re unlikely to start taking action, and what we view as
        ambition becomes fantasy. When you feel lost and overwhelmed you may
        ask, “why bother?” and start to doubt yourself. “I can’t do this”, “this
        is too difficult”, and “I’m not good enough” are all thoughts I’ve had
        when trying to change my life for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the reality is that we just need to take action and
        consistently work toward the goal. If we spend even 5 minutes a day
        moving forward, eventually we’ll achieve it. Even the most complex tasks
        can be broken down into smaller, simpler steps that anyone is capable of
        doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Staying motivated when no one else is cheering you on</h2>
      <p>
        When we’re working toward a goal, we need something—or someone—to
        motivate us. At the start we may have a good reason for doing it, but
        those reasons fade to the background over time. As tasks become more
        difficult, we forget why we wanted this. It helps to have someone gently
        reminding and encouraging us.
      </p>
      <p>
        That way we stay motivated and continue to work toward achieving our
        goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not everyone has that support from friends or family. Others may not
        wish to burden people around them, or they feel embarrassed about their
        goals. GoalCrumbs can help with this by sending automated reminders and
        weekly check-ins to keep you on track.
